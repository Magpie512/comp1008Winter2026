//Question 2.1
//Write a program that prints the following exactly:
//Welcome to Java Programming!

public class q21 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // public means that the method can be accessed from outside the class
        // static means that the method belongs to the class and not to an instance of the class
        // void means that the method does not return any value
        // main is the name of the method that is called when the program starts
        // String[] args is an array of strings that can be passed to the program when it is run
        // args can be used to pass command line arguments to the program
